Star date 647.435
We have encountered a new form of life that appears to spend most of it's time tapping at small buttons and staring at ever-changing symbols on flat, light emitting devices. They appear to pose little threat, primarily as they are not easily distracted from their task, whatever that may be. None the less, we have taken the precaution of boosting shields by reversing the polarity of the main deflector,and simultaneously emitting positron bursts, setting up a pulsed resonance reverse field. We intend to study this enigmatic breed and attempt to acertain the purpose of their work. Crew morale remains high.
